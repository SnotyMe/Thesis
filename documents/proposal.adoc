= Diploma Thesis Snoty.Me - Proposal
== Title
Snoty.Me: Conception and Implementation of a Notification and Task Management Platform for the Educational Sector

== Current Situation
With the ongoing digitization, the educational sector has seen plenty of tools arise to fulfill every possible use case, often with overlapping functionality.
This surge led to increased mental overhead for students that now have to closely monitor multiple platforms for changes. For example, this can result in:

1. unnoticed cancellation of lessons
2. forgotten homework
3. unannounced, time-critical tasks being overlooked entirely

== Things to Research
=== Development
1. extendable base framework
   a. inputs -> system -> outputs
   b. exponential amount of combinations +
      => generic (templating) system required
2. Integration with WebUntis
   a. oAuth2 Flow or similar?
   b. registration as an integration partner? +
      => how would this work for self-hosted instances
3. Integration with Moodle
   a. oAuth2 Flow or comparable?
   b. Mobile app tokens?
4. authentication mechanisms +
   => how will the user sign in to the application
5. usefulness of a mobile app
6. how to help the user self-host the entire application
   a. Docker Image
   b. Docker-Compose example
   c. Raw Kubernetes Manifests
   d. Helm Chart

=== Scientific Research
1. how many students are affected by this problem
   * what is the impact on their daily life
2. which integrations have the most demand
3. willingness of students to pay for such a service
4. the impact of the integrations on the day-to-day life of the students
   * e.g. measuring the number of submissions after notifications
   * does it help with procrastination and time management?
   * does task awareness increase?

== Goal
A self-hostable application with a SaaS offering that allows students to connect their LMSs with their tools and services.

== Planned Result
* intuitive user interface
  ** measured by conducting surveys and monitoring metrics
* straightforward LMS connection
  ** no maintenance required after the initial setup
* powerful, yet uncomplicated target configuration
    ** basics are simple to set up
    ** advanced customizability possible, if wanted

== Milestones
_no dates yet as they largely depend on how well the integration of the external platforms goes_

* base server framework
* PoC Moodle & WebUntis data fetching
* input diffs (comparing versions to detect changes)
* basic frontend
* authentication
* routing + target services (backend only)
* configuring routing in frontend
* advanced configuration
